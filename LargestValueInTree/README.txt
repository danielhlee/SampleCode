Wrote a method that returns an array in which the first element is the largest value in the row with depth 0, the second element is the largest value in the row with depth 1, the third element is the largest element in the row with depth 2, etc from a binary tree.

For Example:

t = {
    "value": -1,
    "left": {
        "value": 5,
        "left": null,
        "right": null
    },
    "right": {
        "value": 7,
        "left": null,
        "right": {
            "value": 1,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        }
    }
}

The tree in the example looks like this:

    -1
   / \
  5   7
       \
        1
        
        
The output of largestValuesInTreeRows(t) would be [-1, 7, 1].


In the row with depth 0, there is only one vertex - the root with value -1;
In the row with depth 1, there are two vertices with values 5 and 7, so the largest value here is 7;
In the row with depth 2, there is only one vertex with value 1.
